# MBTI -> Cognitive Stack converter 

Each Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) has its own set of cognitive functions, or "stack".

I like to force people's entire personalities through this model sometimes, and needed a nice easy way to look up a given type's stack. 

The script is written using the actual conversion logic, and is tested with the "lookup table" approach.
