# MBTI -> Cognitive Stack converter 

Each Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) has its own set of cognitive functions, or "stack".

I like MBTI for its utility in categorising personality. I needed a nice easy way to look up a given type's stack to help me understand more at a glance. 

The script is written using the actual conversion logic, and is tested with the "lookup table" approach.
