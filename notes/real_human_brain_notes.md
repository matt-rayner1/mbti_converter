# BIG THINKS

just figure out the actual conversion process logically so you are ssure on it 100%
reverse the rules to go from fns -> mbti 

each one has a "weighting" and "order".

args need to be parsed look up the docs and finally memorise it 

--fns argument considerations:
How many fns can the user input, 1-4?
obviously need good user input parsing 


"suggested match" type return, how to handle "could be this could be that"
